Multithreaded variant of the program "singlePrimeCube" in https://github.com/Kaelygon/cubeprime

Finds N with property that N^3=A^3+B^3+C^3 multithreaded 
OEIS A157026 https://oeis.org/A157026/
A,B,C>=0 N>2 A!=B!=C

Usage ./cubesum [config file]

If no argument is given, default file is ./prime.cfg, if file or some elements dont exist the program uses following default values:

	thread_count=1					# thread count
	start=0							# start
	end=1000						# end
	progress_file=lastSolve.txt		# store last computed A
	thread_file_suffix=x			# thread logs output file suffix e.g. x = 11x.txt 
	work_directory=./				# thread and progress files location
	clear_file=0					# clear thread and progress files before compute
	update_rate=256					# log threads progress every update_rate

Elements order don't matter in config file. Comment lines with '#'

Results are stored in [work_directory]/TIDx.txt where TID is thread id

./datath/peak.sh: manual grep for any found matches, least and most progressed core. Handy findig out which thread files have results.

You can enter q, quit during run and the program will save last solved A to [work_directory]/[progress_file]
Once finished press enter
